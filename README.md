# React-Game

## Description

Simple React Memory Game that uses Bootstrap for the UI layout. The most important fact about this app was to separate the different parts of the User Interface into components, and [use them as needed](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html). 


## App Rules/Description

 * The App starts by rendering 12 symbols.

 * The user can only click on the same image once, and once he/she clicks on a symbol the pictures are shuffled.

 * By clicking on the different symbols, the user score increments by 1, but if the user clicks on the same symbol more than once, their score gets reset to 0.

 * The app also keeps track of the user's Top Score, and it will update it if someone scores a higher score.
